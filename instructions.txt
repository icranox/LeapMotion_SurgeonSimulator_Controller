Instructions:
Before you start the application, your Leap must be plugged in and working ;)
Run Surgeon Simulator until you are at the desk (main menu). Press escape to pause the game,
then Alt+tab. Now run the LeapMotion_SurgeonSimulator.exe, the program should maximize Surgeon Simulator again.
It is advised that you resume the game first before starting to use your hand, also note that with the current
settings it is probably very uncomfortable to play... I might make it configurable on one of these days.
Also note the program quits if Surgeon Simulator loses the main focus.
